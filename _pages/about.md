I'm a Ph.D. student in the MIT–MechE/WHOI Joint Program, where I research multi-agent planning and autonomy. I'm fortunate to be advised by Dr. Michael Benjamin in [MIT’s Marine Autonomy Laboratory](https://lamss.mit.edu/pavlab/pmwiki/pmwiki.php). Previously, I was an AI/ML Research Scientist at [Aurora Flight Sciences](https://www.aurora.aero/), working on many projects including the [DARPA Learning Introspective Control](https://www.aurora.aero/2024/07/29/advancing-adaptive-technology-for-better-vehicle-control/) program. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Aerospace Engineering. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in [TAFLab](https://taflab.berkeley.edu/) with Dr. Reza Alam, [HiPeRLab](https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/) with Dr. Mark Mueller, and completed a visiting research internship with the University of Oxford’s [Computational Biology Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/compbio/). You can find more details in my [CV](assets/pdf/Karan_Mahesh_CV.pdf).

Beyond research, I'm passionate about ethical entrepreneurship and creating strong, safe mobility networks.

In my free time, I enjoy tackling DIY projects, cooking my way through [Snoop Dogg’s cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Crook-Cook-Platinum-Recipes-Kitchen/dp/1452179611), and hunting for great deals on eBay.
