I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Aerospace Engineering. During my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to conduct research at [TAFLab](https://taflab.berkeley.edu/) with Dr. Reza Alam and [HiPeRLab](https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/) with Dr. Mark Mueller, as well as visiting research at the University of Oxford's [Computational Biology Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/compbio/). I've also worked at Intel Corporation as an AI Intern and a Deep Learning Engineering Intern. For more information, take a look at my [CV](assets/pdf/Karan_Mahesh_CV.pdf).

Outside of work, I'm passionate about impactful, ethical entrepreneurship and connecting people through strong and safe mobility networks.

In my free time, I like working on household DIY projects, cooking through [Snoop Dogg's cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Crook-Cook-Platinum-Recipes-Kitchen/dp/1452179611), and finding deals on eBay.
